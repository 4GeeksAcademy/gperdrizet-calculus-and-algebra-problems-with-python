# Linear Regression & Optimization Assignment


## Overview
This project introduces students to optimization using Python. You'll work with synthetic data to explore the relationship between attendance and grades, and implement your own optimization routine to fit a linear model.

**Note:** This is a toy example project designed to give a high-level, conceptual understanding of linear regression and optimization. It is not intended to cover the detailed mathematics or advanced techniques used in professional regression analysis.

## Learning Goals
- Understand the basics of linear regression and model fitting
- Learn how to quantify model error and optimize parameters
- Gain hands-on experience with Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib
- Practice writing custom functions for modeling and optimization

## Running in GitHub Codespaces
1. **Fork the repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the GitHub page to create your own copy of the repository.
2. **Open Codespace**: Click the green "Code" button, navigate to the "Codespaces" tab and choose "Create codespace on main".

## Assignment Instructions
1. **Open the notebook**: Navigate to [`optimization.ipynb`](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/gperdrizet-optimization-bonus-assignment/blob/main/optimization.ipynb).
2. **Complete the functions**: Implement the required functions for the linear model, error calculation, and optimizer as described in the notebook markdown cells.
3. **Run and test**: Execute each cell to test your code and visualize results.
4. **Analyze**: Reflect on the model's performance and optimization process in the final results section.
